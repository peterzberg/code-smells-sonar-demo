# code-smells-sonar-demo
this is a demo repository for the presentation day for [alcor academy](https://alcor.academy/)

## how to prevent code
- know the rules
  - upfront
- know someone who knows the rules
  - maybe senior developer?
  - two-man-rule?
- know something that knows some rules
  - static code analysis with sonar

Sonar may give you some hints about where your code is smelly. May be configured to your needs (coupling, object calisthenics ;-))
